This



 is the most general definition, and would include all subjects in the universe. In abstract mathematics, of course, operations alter those particular relations which are involved in the considerations of number and space, and the results of the operations or those peculiar results which correspond to the nature of the subjects of operation. But the science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value; just as logic has its own peculiar truth and value, independently of the subjects to which we may apply its reasoning and processes. Those who are accustomed to some of the more modern views of the above subject, will know that a few fundamental relations being true, certain other combinations or relations must necessarily follow; combinations which, however varied and extensive proceeding from the primary relations, are yet simple enough. They will also be aware that one main reason why the separation of the science of operations has been little felt, and why its very nature has not been defined in any distinct manner, is because it has been so intimately combined with and absorbed in the consideration of mathematical notation.
